# Dysphonia Classification Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Dysphonia Classification Project! This project leverages machine learning, specifically a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), to classify dysphonia conditions using user-captured audio. The goal is to distinguish between healthy and pathological voice conditions.

The project includes an interactive and user-friendly web application, allowing users to easily capture their audio for analysis. The meticulously trained CNN processes the audio data, providing a classification result indicating whether the voice condition is healthy or pathological.

## Features

- **Machine Learning Classification:** Utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network for accurate dysphonia classification.
- **Web Application:** An interactive and user-friendly web application for audio capture and classification.
- **Audio Capture:** Allows users to conveniently capture their voice audio for analysis.
- **Healthy vs. Pathological Classification:** Provides insights into whether the voice condition is healthy or pathological.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/dysphonia_classification.git
   cd dysphonia_classification

   
Usage :
Launch the web application.
Capture your voice audio using the provided interface.
Submit the audio for classification.
Receive the classification result indicating healthy or pathological voice condition.
